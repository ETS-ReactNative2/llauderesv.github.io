      <p>
        I am very passionate about in Software Engineering. It's a kind of fun
        when developing something new that you've never done before. I want to
        explore more ideas that are related in Technology. I have a lot of
        experiences in developing softwares such as Websites and Mobile Apps.
        I'm capable of doing front-end and back-end stuff. "My goal in life is
        to build something great that solve other people's problem".
